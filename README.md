# Tamago

Tamago is an attempt at building a practical programming language that can both run efficiently in a web browser and be used for teaching programming. This means that instead of novel features or ideas in Tamago, it brings together features that have been found to work well in existing languages. It also lays out these features in layers, such that different styles and ideas of programming can be introduced gradually, without needlessly burdening the student with unrelated concepts.
